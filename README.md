# Plugin Manager with Module Federation

- This an experiment to directly work with npm modules via the plugin-manager integration with Module Federation
- The project is a fork of the excellent video tutorial by [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFNxTy3fOO0&t=10s) and replaces the access of resources from unpkg.com to directly accessing these from the npm repo and integrating it with the Module Federation Plugin.
